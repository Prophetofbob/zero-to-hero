# Introduction to Design & Bootstrap basics
In this repository, you will find relevant files for the Intro to Design + Bootstrap Basics workshop as a part of the Zero to Hero series run by Hack Western.

In the resources folder, I've compiled several files including the workshop's PowerPoint slides, a cheat sheet, and miscellaneous resources to help you out as you move along in your design career. 

The other portion of this repository will be the Github Pages (gh-pages) branch, which will serve as a basis for our Bootstrap portion.

If you have any questions before or after the workshop, feel free to contact me at *cathy@hackwestern.com*.
